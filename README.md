<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<h4>Main goal</h4>

My main goal for this site was to get better at React JS and to learn how to use an Api and to use styled-components. I chose to use PokéApi because there is a lot of tutorials to start from, the documentation is very clear and easy to use and there is a ton of informations so I could make an bigger site with multiple pages.

<h4>Contents</h4>

- All the 898 pokémon + regional variants, mega and gmax
- Moves : basic data, effect, pokémon that can learn it, ...
- Abilities : effect, pokémon that have this ability (normal or hidden), ...
- Types : effectiveness against other types, pokémon with this type, ...
- Items : effect, flinch power, ...
- Machines : list of tm and hm for every game
- Locations : coming soon
