<h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h2>

<h4>Features</h4>

‚úÖA page for every pok√©mon / move / ability / type / item  
‚úÖFilter pok√©mon by name / form / generation / type (possibility to filter by one or two types)  
‚úÖFilter moves / abilities / machines by name  
‚úÖChange certain data according to the game selected  
‚úÖPok√©mon cries  
‚úÖDark mode  
‚úÖ404 page  
‚úÖAutocomplete search  
‚úÖResponsive

üõ†Use React-Table for my tables (allow for virtualization, sorting and filtering)  
üõ†Use Framer Motion to add animations

üîúProfile page with possibility to save teams  
üîúTypes relations for each pok√©mon  
üîúContest section in a move's page

<h4>Performance improvements</h4>

‚úÖUse of Next SSG for static pages and SSR for dynamic pages.  
‚úÖUse of React-Query to fetch data only once by using `cacheTime: Infinity` and `staleTime: Infinity`. The data will very rarely change so there is no use in re-fetching it every x minutes / hours.  
‚úÖUse of Next JS next/image to optimize images. Very important for this app because some pages (like the index.js or the items.js) have a lot of images and they are one of the main problems regarding my performances so optimizing them to make the loading faster is very important.  
‚úÖUse of dynamic import (the Next JS equivalent of lazy loading component from ES2020) to load components when they are needed by the users. This means that if a user never interacts with a component that is dynamically imported, it will never be loaded.  
‚úÖTurned into a PWA with the next-pwa package.

üõ†Refactoring the code  

üîúImplement PokeAPI Service Worker.

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<h4>Main goal</h4>

My main goal for this site was to get better at React JS and to learn how to use an API and to use Styled-Components.  
I chose to use Pok√©API because there are a lot of tutorials to start from, the documentation is very clear and easy to use and there is a ton of information so I could make a bigger site with multiple pages.

<h4>Story of this project</h4>

- Started by using vanilla JS + Sass to learn how to fetch data from an API in vanilla JS
- Quickly moved to React JS + Sass to learn React by working on a big project
- Moved to React JS + Styled-Components to learn a new way to write CSS. It was a good move for me because I really like Styled-Components because it has the advantages of Sass, is easily importable / exportable between files and supports theming.
- Added React-Query to fetch data. It's a great library that makes it easy to manage caching, fetching, loading and error handling for every data fetch.
- Finally moved to Next JS (instead of CRA) + Styled-Components to learn to use Next JS. I chose to use Next JS to benefit from the image optimization given by the <Image /> component because the app has a lot of images to render and every optimization is welcome. I also chose it to benefit from the Static-Site generation.
- Upgraded to Next 13. There were some problems that made the transition to using the app folder instead of the pages one not possible, but I benefited from the changes to the <Image /> component (it no longer creates spans) and the <Link /> component (it no longer need to have an anchor tag inside).
- Added React-Table and converted all my tables to benefit from virtualization, sorting and filtering for every column making it easier to find the desired information.

<h4>Problems encountered (ordered from the oldest to the most recent)</h4>

- Learning to fetch data from an API and use this data. That was the first time that I've used an API and at first I had problems to understand how the fetch API worked and how to use and display the data returned.
- Moving to Styled-Components. Not a big problem because it uses nesting like Sass so I didn't have to modify a lot of CSS, but I had to learn how to create global styles and how to create themes and switch between them.
- Implementing an infinite scroll (now removed) in React with <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component" target="_blank">react-infinite-scroll-component</a>. I had problems with creating the function that fetches more data and the function that says when there are more elements to return. Maybe I'll try to implement it with React-Query but it's currently not a priority.
- Tried to virtualize the moves, abilities and items pages' lists. I tried to implement it by using <a href="https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized" target="_blank">react-virtualized</a> and <a href="https://github.com/petyosi/react-virtuoso" target="_blank">react-virtuoso</a>, but I had a few problems (the main one being that it did not take into account the sorting of the list and returned the list without it).
- Implementing React-Query. I had to learn how to modify my custom hooks to make it work with React-Query and how to import the data from the hooks. It took me some time to make the transition works, but I don't regret it because my code is more readable (mainly the part where I import my hooks, but also the way I handle the loading state to return an animation while the data is being fetched) and it's an easy way to cache data.
- Moving from CRA to Next. The main problem I had was learning to use dynamic routing and when I understood it the migration became easier. It still took me some time because I had to move all my files in other folders, change the paths in imports, implement the <Image /> component along with a width and height, correct some problems with the images (the creation of multiple spans wrapping the image that was solved by using next/future/image before moving to Next 13) and a few other problems with the <Link /> component (the fact that it can't have multiple children, that it needs to have a 'href' instead of the 'to' used in react-router to give the path and that you need to put an anchor tag inside the Link and use passHref).
- Converting all the files to Typescript and declare all the types. Currently working on it and nearly finished.
