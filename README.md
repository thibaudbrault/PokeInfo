<h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h2>

<h4>Features - Front</h4>

‚úÖA page for every Pok√©mon / move / ability / type / item and more  
‚úÖFilter Pok√©mon by name / form / generation  
‚úÖFilter moves / abilities / machines by name  
‚úÖFuzzy search for Pok√©mon / moves / abilities and items pages  
‚úÖChange certain data according to the game selected  
‚úÖPok√©mon cries (up to Pok√©mon n¬∞ 721)  
‚úÖCompetitive information for every Pok√©mon with data from Smogon  
‚úÖList of every Pok√©mon cards for every Pok√©mon  
‚úÖDark and light mode  
‚úÖ404 page  
‚úÖResponsive

üîúContest section in a move's page

<h4>Features - Back</h4>

‚úÖUse of Next-Auth to handle login / log out with credentials  
‚úÖSession context with the `useSession` hook from Next-Auth  
‚úÖProtected profile page with server redirection for unauthenticated users  
‚úÖUser data saved in a Planetscale database  
‚úÖUse of Prisma and Tanstack-Query to handle queries and mutations  
‚úÖPossibility to save / remove favorites Pok√©mon

üõ†Fix auth problems

üîúAdd possibility to modify a profile

<h4>Performance improvements</h4>

‚úÖUse of Tanstack-Query to fetch data only once by using `cacheTime: Infinity` and `staleTime: Infinity`. The data will very rarely change so there is no use in re-fetching it every x minutes / hours  
‚úÖUse of Next JS next/image to optimize images. Very important for this app because some pages (like the index.js or the items.js) have a lot of images and they are one of the main problems regarding my performances so optimizing them to make the loading faster is very important  
‚úÖTurned into a PWA with the next-pwa package  
‚úÖPaginated pokedex, moves, abilities and items pages

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<h4>Main goal</h4>

My main goal for this site was to get better at React JS and to learn how to use an API and to use Styled-Components.  
I chose to use Pok√©API because there are a lot of tutorials to start from, the documentation is very clear and easy to use and there is a ton of information so I could make a bigger site with multiple pages.

<h4>Story of this project</h4>

- Started by using vanilla JS + Scss to learn how to fetch data from an API in vanilla JS
- Quickly moved to React JS + Scss to learn React by working on a big project
- Moved to React JS + Styled-Components to learn a new way to write CSS. It was a good move for me because I really like Styled-Components because it has the advantages of Scss, is easily importable / exportable between files and supports theming.
- Added React-Query to fetch data. It's a great library that makes it easy to manage caching, fetching, loading and error handling for every data fetch.
- Finally moved to Next JS (instead of CRA) + Styled-Components to learn to use Next JS. I chose to use Next JS to benefit from the image optimization given by the <Image /> component because the app has a lot of images to render and every optimization is welcome. I also chose it to benefit from the Static-Site generation.
- Upgraded to Next 13. There were some problems that made the transition to using the app folder instead of the pages one not possible, but I benefited from the changes to the <Image /> component (it no longer creates spans) and the <Link /> component (it no longer need to have an anchor tag inside).
- Added React-Table and converted all my tables to benefit from virtualization, sorting and filtering for every column making it easier to find the desired information.
- Added Firebase for authentication and saving a user's caught Pok√©mon with data stored in Firestore.
- Changed all the structure folder and moved from Styled-Components to Scss modules.
- Removed Firebase in favor of Prisma + Planetscale.
- Migrate to Railway to use a more familiar tool.

<h4>Problems encountered (ordered from the oldest to the most recent)</h4>

- Learning to fetch data from an API and use this data. That was the first time that I've used an API and at first I had problems to understand how the fetch API worked and how to use and display the data returned.
- Moving to Styled-Components. Not a big problem because it uses nesting like Sass so I didn't have to modify a lot of CSS, but I had to learn how to create global styles and how to create themes and switch between them.
- Implementing an infinite scroll (now removed) in React with <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component" target="_blank">react-infinite-scroll-component</a>. I had problems with creating the function that fetches more data and the function that says when there are more elements to return. Maybe I'll try to implement it with React-Query but it's currently not a priority.
- Tried to virtualize the moves, abilities and items pages' lists. I tried to implement it by using <a href="https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized" target="_blank">react-virtualized</a> and <a href="https://github.com/petyosi/react-virtuoso" target="_blank">react-virtuoso</a>, but I had a few problems (the main one being that it did not take into account the sorting of the list and returned the list without it).
- Implementing React-Query. I had to learn how to modify my custom hooks to make it work with React-Query and how to import the data from the hooks. It took me some time to make the transition works, but I don't regret it because my code is more readable (mainly the part where I import my hooks, but also the way I handle the loading state to return an animation while the data is being fetched) and it's an easy way to cache data.
- Moving from CRA to Next. The main problem I had was learning to use dynamic routing and when I understood it the migration became easier. It still took me some time because I had to move all my files in other folders, change the paths in imports, implement the <Image /> component along with a width and height, correct some problems with the images (the creation of multiple spans wrapping the image that was solved by using next/future/image before moving to Next 13) and a few other problems with the <Link /> component (the fact that it can't have multiple children, that it needs to have a 'href' instead of the 'to' used in react-router to give the path and that you need to put an anchor tag inside the Link and use passHref).
- Converting all the files to Typescript and declare all the types.
- Make my components fully reusable.
